# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Originally, a basic, console-logged rock/paper/scissors game where the user would input their move, computer would then choose a move at random, and the script logs to the console if the user won, lost, or tied the computer. Best of 5 won.

This new and improved branch adds UI functionality.
